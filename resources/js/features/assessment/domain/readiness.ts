 * The "Fundor Readiness Score" (0–100) the free assessment ends on — the

 *
 * **Ported unchanged, and deliberately kept apart from the real Fundor Score.**
 * It is a shallow additive heuristic over five answers: it never looks at the
 * catalog or at eligibility, so a visitor can score high here while qualifying
 * for few calls. Whether to keep, unify or replace it is an open product
 * decision (see frontend/README.md); this file is the only place to change.
 * The server stores whatever number the browser sends as the lead's
 * "assessment result" and does not recompute it.
