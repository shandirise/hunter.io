/**
 * Sources, promoted out of the hero's small print into their own visible
 * row directly under the fold — credibility a visitor sees without
 * scrolling, not two lines of grey text tucked under the buttons. Kept
 * deliberately short; `Sources` further down the page carries the full
 * explanation and the same underlying list.
 *
 * Sits inside the hero's own dark chapter (no background of its own) — a
 * separate boxed strip would put a hard seam right under the hero.
 *
 * Scrolls continuously rather than sitting as one static line — a plain
 * `overflow-x-auto` row of the same content would either wrap awkwardly on
 * narrow screens or truncate, and this list is only going to grow. Two
 * back-to-back copies of the content, translated exactly -50%, is what
 * makes the loop seamless; reduced motion gets the plain static line
 * instead, once, not the doubled track.
