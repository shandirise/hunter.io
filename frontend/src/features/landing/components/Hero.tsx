 * it overlaps a photo panel behind it rather than sitting in a tidy paired
 * column. The headline itself stays outside that column (a rigid 50/50 grid

 * the real font before settling on `max-w-250` — see the decisions log), so
 * the photo only occupies the row below it, never competing with the
 * headline's own width.
 *
 * The photo (`hero-manufacturing.jpg`) is a placeholder — Pexels, not a
 * commissioned shot — standing in until real photography exists. Swap the
 * import when it does; the gradient treatment around it doesn't depend on
 * the specific image.

        The photo panel and the card share this box: the panel is the card's backdrop, not a

        Two photo layouts, not one repositioned element — the desktop panel bleeds to the true
        viewport edge via `absolute inset-y-0 right-0` (this box has no max-width ancestor to
        bleed past), which a `<md` screen has no room for; the mobile strip is a normal full-bleed
        block instead (`-mx-6` cancels the section's own padding).

        `pointer-events-none` here, `-auto` on the photo blob below: `md:-mt-16` pulls this box's
        own (relative-positioned, so painted above normal-flow siblings) hit-test box up over the
        CTA row above at short enough text/widths — same bug, same fix, as the card's own wrapper
        a few lines down. The photo blob re-enables `pointer-events-auto` so hovering it still
        bubbles `onMouseMove`/`onMouseLeave` up to this wrapper (pointer-events on an ancestor
        doesn't stop bubbling through an auto-enabled descendant, only whether the ancestor itself
        can be the hit target).
